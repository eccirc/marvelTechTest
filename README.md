## About

This project leverages the official Marvel API to get information about Marvel characters.
Via different API endpoint, one can access:
- A list of 1500 Marvel character Id's:  **/characters**
- Basic information about a single Marvel character (name, description, thumbnail image link)
  **/characters/{id}**
- The same as above but with the description translated to a language of your choice
(specified in the URL path):   **/characters/{id}/{lang}**
 *See [here](https://www.labnol.org/code/19899-google-translate-languages) for a list of language codes*

## Technologies

**Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Googgle Cloud API's (Translate)**
